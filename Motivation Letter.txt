Among the four PhD projects offered in the Gravitation and Cosmology Research Group of the University of Sheffield, the project 'Clocks and singularities in quantum gravity and quantum cosmology' is the one I am most interested in. During my Master's thesis I had the chance to learn about the intricacies of a quantum theory of gravity, namely Loop Quantum Gravity, which I found fascinating. Moreover, I have always been interested in understanding in depth the concept of 'time' which, even though the idea of 'time' has been known for thousands of years, it is still something we know little about. This is the reason why I find this thesis so appealing.


On the other hand, moving to a different country would grant me with a unique opportunity to meet new people and get to know different cultures.
